#  💄TheMindfulBeauty😄

~Change in direction due to data set/API issues!~
A basic app designed for skincare shoppers who want to be mindful where their money goes. Shoppers can see **how ethical and sustainable** skin care brands are before purchasing! 

##  🔍 About

In recent times, it is much easier to access nutrition information from apps like Yuka, which rate products based on ingredients, additives, and organic status. But what if we also knew how **eco-friendly** or **ethical** those products were?

TheMindfulFoodie is a project inspired by that idea and wanting to take it futher. It will allow users to:

- Search for food products by name.
- View ingredients and nutritional information.
- See extra info like eco-scores, company ethics, and sustainability. 
- Link out to trusted data sources for deeper insight.

##  🤔 Why This App?

I believe we must be mindful of where our money goes and which companies we support while shopping. While using similar apps, I often wished it included ratings for:

- Environmental impact 🌍  
- Company practices 💼
- Fair trade and ethics 🤝 

And with my growing knowledge of Information Systems tools, I am making that wish a reality🪄

## 🤓 Tools & Tech

- **Tkinter** (for GUI)

##  🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration(?)

This app is being made solo! If time (and energy) permits, I plan to expand the app include more complex features like visualizations or charts.

## ✍️ Notes

- Initial version will focus on search + basic display.
- Info depth is still being decided. At minimum, the app will link to external resources for more details.

The TheMindfulFoodie is currently under construction. Stay tuned as I make my dream app a reality ~at a much smaller scale~ to help my fellow foodies make **informed and conscious food choices**🫡
